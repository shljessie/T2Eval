  "design_principles": {
    "2.10": "If the concept of depth is not required, a 3-dimensional view should be changed to a 2-dimensional view.",
    "2.11": "Clarity of components is improved by creating a break (blank space) between adjacent textures or where lines cross other lines or textures.",
    "2.12": "If the reader is required to measure a line or an object, the line or object should not be lengthened or enlarged and must be raised and designed in a way that permits measurement with a braille ruler.",
    "2.13": "If the reader is required to measure distance, the scale and graphic must be revised proportionately."

    "spacing": "Grid lines should be no closer than 3/8 inch (1 centimeter) to prevent looking like an area texture."

    "composition": "An arrow should be comprised of a shaft and either an elongated solid triangle or an open arrowhead.",
