  "2.10": "If the concept of depth is not required, a 3-dimensional view should be changed to a 2-dimensional view.",
  "2.11": "Clarity of components is improved by creating a break (blank space) between adjacent textures or where lines cross other lines or textures.",
  "2.12": "If the reader is required to measure a line or an object, the line or object should not be lengthened or enlarged and must be raised and designed in a way that permits measurement with a braille ruler.",
  "2.13": "If the reader is required to measure distance, the scale and graphic must be revised proportionately.",
  "3.4.3.1": "Areas. Minimum size 1/4 square inch (6 square millimeters). Very small areas are more easily read if raised above other areas to increase the tactual contrast, or shown below another area that is raised.",
  "3.4.3.2": "Lines. Primary lines must be a minimum of 1/2 inch (1.25 centimeters) in length.",
  "3.4.3.3": "Dashed Primary Lines. The length of each dash should be 1/4 to 3/8 inch (6 millimeters to 1 centimeter), separated by spaces approximately half the length of the dash.",
  "3.4.3.4": "Locational (Secondary) Lines. For tick marks on number lines and graphs, the length must be 1/2 inch (1.25 centimeters) or 1/4 inch (6 millimeters) on each side of the line and shown as less significant than primary lines on the tactile graphic.",
  "3.4.3.5": "Lead lines must be the least significant line in the graphic, with a preferred minimum length of 3/4 inch (2 centimeters) and a preferred maximum length of 1-1/2 inches (3.75 centimeters), with no arrowhead at the end.",
  "3.4.3.6": "One end of the lead line should touch the component it identifies and the other end should be at least 1/8 inch (3 millimeters) from the beginning or end of the braille label.",
  "3.4.3.7": "Arrows. An arrow should be comprised of a shaft and either an elongated solid triangle or an open arrowhead. The shaft may be a solid or broken line, but the shaft and arrowhead should be approximately the same weight.",
  "3.4.3.8": "Grid lines must be less significant than other information shown on the graph so they do not interfere with reading the graph’s content.",
  "3.4.3.9": "In order to keep the grid from looking like an area texture, it is recommended that grid lines be no closer than 3/8 inch (1 centimeter).",
  "3.4.3.10": "Axis lines should be stronger than grid lines and include an arrowhead at the outer ends if shown in print.",
  "3.4.3.11": "Point Symbols. For discrimination between two or more different-shaped symbols, the minimum diameter must be at least 1/4 inch (6 millimeters). The space between a point symbol and any other component must be a minimum of 1/8 inch (3 millimeters).",
  "3.4.3.12": "Labels. Labels should be placed a minimum of 1/8 inch (3 millimeters) to a maximum of 1/4 inch (6 millimeters) from any other component.",
  "3.4.3.13": "A minimum of 1/8 inch (3 millimeters) ‘blank space’ should be allowed on all sides of the label when embedded in an area texture.",
  "3.4.3.14": "The measurements of the area texture sample for the key are 1/2 inch (1.25 centimeters) high (vertical measurement) and 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) wide (horizontal measurement).",
  "3.4.4": "Size of Paper Graphics produced on different sizes of paper or plastic, but included in the same volume or binder can be more difficult to locate and confusing to the reader.",
  "3.4.4.1": "The presentation and use of the graphic will dictate the size of paper or plastic on which the graphic is produced.",
  "3.4.4.2": "Tactile graphics included in a textbook must be produced in the same overall paper size as the text of the book, usually 11.5 by 11-inches (29 by 28 centimeters).",
  "3.4.4.3": "A tactile graphic produced for direct use by a reader may be any size needed for clarity of the image.",
  "3.4.4.4": "When a tactile graphic is too large to fit on a standard 11.5 by 11-inch braille page (29 by 28 centimeters), a foldable flap may be added to increase the width of the page.",
  "3.6": "Simplification: Many print illustrations are too complex to show tactually without simplification.",
  "3.9": "Separation: To reduce clutter, many complex diagrams should be divided into sections or separated into layers of information.",
  "5.7": "Keys and Legends: The key listing should be presented in the following order: area textures, line textures, point symbols, alphabetic key, numeric key.",
  "5.8": "Alphabetic and Numeric Keys: When space does not permit the inclusion of labels in a tactile graphic, a key is assigned to represent information in a print diagram.",
  "5.9": "Symbol Placement and Measurements in Keys.",
  "5.10": "Label Placement: Labels should be placed horizontally on the tactile graphic master.",
  "5.14": "Graphic Symbols Page: Area, line, or point symbols that are consistently or repeatedly used on diagrams should be placed on the Graphic Symbols page.",
  "x.x": "Symbols of the same type must vary from one another in size by 25 to 30 percent to be perceived as different in size by most users.",
  "x.x": "A graphic should contain no more than five different area textures."
