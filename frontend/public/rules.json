  "2.1": "A tactile graphic is a representation of a print graphic designed in a manner that is the most meaningful to the reader. It is not an exact reproduction.",
  "2.2": "Cost and time must not be the primary considerations when determining the method of production. Choose the most effective production medium for each graphic.",
  "2.3": "The braille code and format used in preparation of the tactile graphic must be consistent with the transcription of the main body of text.",
  "2.4": "The dimensions of the braille text page(s) and any inserted tactile graphic page(s) should be the same. Tactile graphics produced using various media may be combined in the same volume.",
  "2.5": "Some eye-catching design techniques used in print, such as decorative borders, are irrelevant to the concept being taught and should be omitted.",
  "2.6": "Many frames or image outlines found around print diagrams should also be omitted if they would add extra lines without purpose.",
  "2.7": "The tactile graphic should be positioned at the left margin of the page, rather than centered.",
  "2.8": "A print graphic may be simplified as long as the original intent is not compromised.",
  "2.9": "If the task does not involve measurement, modifications to size, position, or layout may be made to an illustration to clarify presentation.",
  "2.10": "If the concept of depth is not required, a 3-dimensional view should be changed to a 2-dimensional view.",
  "2.11": "Clarity of components is improved by creating a break (blank space) between adjacent textures or where lines cross other lines or textures.",
  "2.12": "If the reader is required to measure a line or an object, the line or object should not be lengthened or enlarged and must be raised and designed in a way that permits measurement with a braille ruler.",
  "2.13": "If the reader is required to measure distance, the scale and graphic must be revised proportionately.",
  "2.14": "Use transcribers notes to explain changes made to the print format.",
  "2.15": "When writing transcribers notes, use vocabulary appropriate to the grade level and subject matter of the text.",
  "2.16": "The use of transcribers notes for kindergarten and first grade should be limited.",
  "2.17": "A combination of symbols, keys, and words may be used to convey information.",
  "2.18": "Maintain consistency throughout a transcription when assigning alphabetic keys or textures to a particular item.",
  "2.19": "The age and experience of the reader must be considered when designing a tactile graphic.",
  "2.20": "Facing pages should be used when the key and graphic will not fit on one page.",
  "2.21": "Consider placing tactile graphics on separate pages with limited text so that the graphics may be used with electronic text (e-text).",
  "2.22": "Readability is improved when a variety of heights and textures are used to create areas, lines, and points within a graphic.",
  "2.23": "A tactile cue to assist the reader with proper and efficient orientation of the graphic is recommended.",
  "3.1": "Definition of Primary Components: Area, Line, Point, Label.",
  "3.2": "Editing Content: Facts or data included in a tactile graphic should be selected based on the purpose of the graphic.",
  "3.3": "Planning Process: The use of a planning sheet is recommended to document the planning process.",
  "3.4.3.1": "Areas. Minimum size 1/4 square inch (6 square millimeters). Very small areas are more easily read if raised above other areas to increase the tactual contrast, or shown below another area that is raised. Example: Bodies of water where land is raised.",
  "3.4.3.2": "Lines. Primary lines must be a minimum of 1/2 inch (1.25 centimeters) in length.",
  "3.4.3.3": "Dashed Primary Lines. The length of each dash should be 1/4 to 3/8 inch (6 millimeters to 1 centimeter), separated by spaces approximately half the length of the dash.",
  "3.4.3.4": "Locational (Secondary) Lines. For tick marks on number lines and graphs, the length must be 1/2 inch (1.25 centimeters) or 1/4 inch (6 millimeters) on each side of the line and shown as less significant than primary lines on the tactile graphic.",
  "3.4.3.5": "Lead lines (from component to label) must be the least significant line in the graphic, with a preferred minimum length of 3/4 inch (2 centimeters) and a preferred maximum length of 1-1/2 inches (3.75 centimeters), with no arrowhead at the end. If at all possible, a lead line should be straight.",
  "3.4.3.6": "One end of the lead line should touch the component it identifies and the other end should be at least 1/8 inch (3 millimeters) from the beginning or end of the braille label.",
  "3.4.3.7": "Arrows. An arrow should be comprised of a shaft and either an elongated solid triangle or an open arrowhead. The shaft may be a solid or broken line, but the shaft and arrowhead should be approximately the same weight.",
  "3.4.3.8": "Grid lines must be less significant than other information shown on the graph so they do not interfere with reading the graph’s content.",
  "3.4.3.9": "In order to keep the grid from looking like an area texture, it is recommended that grid lines be no closer than 3/8 inch (1 centimeter).",
  "3.4.3.10": "Axis lines should be stronger than grid lines and include an arrowhead at the outer ends if shown in print.",
  "3.4.3.11": "Point Symbols. For discrimination between two or more different-shaped symbols, the minimum diameter must be at least 1/4 inch (6 millimeters). The space between a point symbol and any other component must be a minimum of 1/8 inch (3 millimeters).",
  "3.4.3.12": "Labels. Labels should be placed a minimum of 1/8 inch (3 millimeters) to a maximum of 1/4 inch (6 millimeters) from any other component. If the label cannot be placed within the minimum and maximum distance, the label must be placed far enough away to allow a 3/4-inch (2 centimeter) lead line.",
  "3.4.3.13": "A minimum of 1/8 inch (3 millimeters) ‘blank space’ should be allowed on all sides of the label when embedded in an area texture.",
  "3.4.3.14": "The measurements of the area texture sample for the key are 1/2 inch (1.25 centimeters) high (vertical measurement) and 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) wide (horizontal measurement).",
  "3.4.4": "Size of Paper Graphics produced on different sizes of paper or plastic, but included in the same volume or binder can be more difficult to locate and confusing to the reader.",
  "3.4.4.1": "The presentation and use of the graphic will dictate the size of paper or plastic on which the graphic is produced.",
  "3.4.4.2": "Tactile graphics included in a textbook must be produced in the same overall paper size as the text of the book, usually 11.5 by 11-inches (29 by 28 centimeters).",
  "3.4.4.3": "A tactile graphic produced for direct use by a reader may be any size needed for clarity of the image.",
  "3.4.4.4": "When a tactile graphic is too large to fit on a standard 11.5 by 11-inch braille page (29 by 28 centimeters), a foldable flap may be added to increase the width of the page.",
  "3.5.3": "When the diagram must be enlarged to provide tactual discrimination, a transcriber’s note must precede the graphic explaining the amount of enlargement. The graphic must be large enough and of sufficient line strength that braille measuring tools (i.e., braille ruler, braille protractor) can be used to accomplish the task. When a diagram such as a map contains a scale and requires enlargement, the scale and the map must be enlarged proportionally.",
  "3.6.1": "Many print illustrations are too complex (i.e., they contain too much information) to show tactually without simplification. Care should be taken not to over-simplify because it may detract from or interfere with the comprehension and intended purpose of the diagram.",
  "3.6.2": "Three-dimensional images are especially difficult to decode. When possible, simplify them to two dimensions. In some cases you may need to show more than one view to include all of the content in the print graphic.",
  "3.9.1": "To reduce clutter, many complex diagrams should be divided into sections or separated into layers of information. A diagram showing the whole image (overview) must appear first to provide the reader with a concept of the whole picture.",
  "3.9.2": "When a diagram is separated into sections or layers of information, a transcriber’s note must indicate what type of division is made and the number of parts into which the illustration is divided.",
  "3.9.3": "Where a complex graphic has been separated into sections, a few points of reference in the overview diagram will allow the reader to understand how the separate parts fit back together.",
  "3.9.4": "A logical division should be selected and a title designated to reflect the position of the divided parts in the whole. The diagram can be divided in half (either horizontally or vertically), divided into quarters (when additional room for enlargement is needed to include details), or divided by a natural landmark (e.g., the United States divided into two sections along the Mississippi River). The lines used to indicate the division should be a distinctly different texture than any other lines used in that graphic and should be shown on each section.",
  "3.6": "Simplification: Many print illustrations are too complex to show tactually without simplification.",
  "3.9": "Separation: To reduce clutter, many complex diagrams should be divided into sections or separated into layers of information.",
  "5.7": "Keys and Legends: The key listing should be presented in the following order: area textures, line textures, point symbols, alphabetic key, numeric key.",
  "5.8": "Alphabetic and Numeric Keys: When space does not permit the inclusion of labels in a tactile graphic, a key is assigned to represent information in a print diagram.",
  "5.9": "Symbol Placement and Measurements in Keys.",
  "5.10": "Label Placement: Labels should be placed horizontally on the tactile graphic master.",
  "5.14": "Graphic Symbols Page: Area, line, or point symbols that are consistently or repeatedly used on diagrams should be placed on the Graphic Symbols page.",
  "5.14.1": "Area, line, or point symbols that are consistently or repeatedly used on diagrams should be placed on the Graphic Symbols page following the Special Symbols page.",
  "5.14.2": "Alphabetic key symbols, such as ISO abbreviations for countries in a geography or history book, should also be placed on this page.",
  "5.14.3": "Format of Graphic Symbols Page.",
  "5.14.4": "The area, line, point, or alphabetic key symbols appear frequently enough to warrant placement on the Graphic Symbols page.",
  "5.14.5": "When symbols fall under identifiable categories, the heading for each category must be brailled with initial capitals and placed as a cell-5 heading above the symbols it identifies.",
  "5.14.6": "The textures used to represent areas and lines start in cell 1, and the explanation starts in cell 6 with runovers in cell 8. Point symbols are to be centered within the first four cells of the line, and the explanation should begin in cell 6 with runovers in cell 8."
